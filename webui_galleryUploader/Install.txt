TO install the gallery picture uploader copy upload.php to sites/admin

copy lang_en.php to languages   (not languages/additional)

change mysql info in upload.php to match your webui database settings.

next use phpmyadmin or other mysql manager and import wi_sitemanagement.sql and  wi_pagemanager.sql to your webui database

this will add the menu items so that you can use the uploader


to use, login to webui as admin  
under the admin menu  click galleryadmin  you can now upload a picture.


What this is; this is a uploader that when it uploads a picture it stores it in your gallery folder  and adds the information to your sql database.
